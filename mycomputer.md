# Computer Specs: 
My name is Sima from 10th grade, these are my laptop specifications:

1. MacBook Air 13 inches (version 10.12.6)
2. The Operating System is macOS Sierra.
3. Central Processing Unit [CPU] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/central-processing-unit#:~:text=A%20central%20processing%20unit%20(CPU,are%20required%20for%20processing%20data.) : 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5. This is the part/chip of the computer were data is processed and were logic and calculations take place. 
4.  (RAM):Random Acess Memory is 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3, defined by the size of the RAM capacity this allow you to work with a document interactively without losing memory.
5. [STORAGE:] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYdvB_kwJXk) 121 GB hard disc drive storage.

 ## Commentary
1. I do like my computer, it's light it has good audio and a clear screen it has both an Arabic and English keyboard, but I think it's time for a new one because the hard drive is slow so I'm thinking of changing it into **SSD drive** (Solid State Drive) and it glitches sometimes during upload.
2. The way my computers performance is affected by it's hardware configuration is hard disk speed, the hardrive speed, sometimes the number of applications/ programs running and open does slow down your computer and affects the transfer of data and processing of programs.What makes my computer slow down is the size of the files,age of the hardrive and connectivity to wifi and ports which is impactd by the speed of the internet available.
3.In conclusion, I've learnt how to discover the specifcations of my laptop and knowing the **input and output devices**, as well as storage devices.
